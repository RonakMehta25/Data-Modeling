Types of Keys
1. Primary Keys
2. Foreign Keys
3. Candidate Keys
Candidate keys are selected from the set of super keys, the only thing we take care while selecting candidate key is: It should not have any redundant attribute. Thatâ€™s the reason they are also termed as minimal super key.

4. Super Keys (column or number of columns that forces every rows to be unique)
5. Surrogate Keys
Just added incremental column which have no real world meaning.

6. Natural Keys
Already present in the data.

7. Alternate Keys
As we have seen in the candidate key guide that a table can have multiple candidate keys. Among these candidate keys, only one key gets selected as primary key, the remaining keys are known as alternative or secondary keys.

8. Composite Keys
A key that has more than one attributes is known as composite key. It is also known as compound key.
