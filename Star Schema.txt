Star Schema

In the STAR Schema, the center of the star can have one fact table and a number of associated dimension tables.

Every dimension in a star schema is represented with the only one-dimension table.

The dimension table is joined to the fact table using a foreign key

The dimension table are not joined to each other

Fact table would contain key and measure

The dimension tables are not normalized. For instance, in the above figure, Country_ID does not have Country lookup table as an OLTP design would have.

Star schema is widely used by all OLAP systems to design OLAP cubes efficiently. In fact, major OLAP systems deliver a ROLAP mode of operation which can use a star schema as a source without designing a cube structure.


Snowflake Schema

It is used to represent ER diagram.

A Snowflake Schema is an extension of a Star Schema, and it adds additional dimensions. 

The dimension tables are normalized which splits data into additional tables.

Tables are normalized thus reduce redunduncy. This may have complex design.

The number of joins can increase and hence query performance can decrease

The snowflake schema uses small disk space.
It is easy to implement dimension is added to schema.

Galaxy Schema

A GALAXY SCHEMA contains two fact table that share dimension tables between them. It is also called Fact Constellation Schema.
