E-commerce Database Design


Basic Design Principles
Most E-commerce applications use a similar design with 4 basic tables. There may be other ancillary tables to support things like shipping, taxes, categories for searching, etc. I am going to focus on these four core tables.

Customers Table - holds customer information like address, shipping address, billing address, etc.
Products Table - holds product information like product name, description, size, color, unit price, etc.
Orders Table - holds information on when an order was placed including Customer ID, date of order, order shipping date, etc.
Order Details Table - holds information on each product ordered on one order (since typically you can purchase multiple items on the same order) including the product ordered, quantity, unit price, any discounts, etc.
